# Build JW OTT Webapp from the Source Code

In order to create a deployable version of JW OTT Webapp, follow these instructions in this document.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are needed to start building JW OTT Webapp. Follow the instructions on the links below:

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Build the JW OTT Webapp

1. Clone the **ott-web-app** repository on your local machine.

```shell
$ cd ~/

$ git clone https://github.com/jwplayer/ott-web-app.git
$ cd ott-web-app
```

2. Install the required dependencies. Optional dependencies include packages that are not necessary to build the project. These optional dependencies can be safely ignored.

```shell
$ yarn --ignore-optional
```

> **NOTE**: Some of the [easy deployments](easy-deployments.md) instructions require installing these optional dependencies. Use the `yarn` command to install all dependencies. The `yarn` command can be run even if `yarn --ignore-optional` has been previously run.

3. Create or update the .ini files in `/platforms/web/ini` for the modes you will be running in (probably dev and prod).
   You can copy the ini file from `/platforms/web/ini/templates` into `/platforms/web/ini`. The files in `/platforms/web/ini` are git-ignored, so you do not need to worry about account values in source control, but you will need to recreate the ini files each time you make a fresh checkout of the repository.

   The .ini files provide startup values to the application such as which app config to load by default. See [initialization-file](initialization-file.md) for more details.

4. Start the local development server.

```shell
$ cd platforms/web
$ yarn start
```

If you encounter any errors, make sure you have correctly set the `defaultConfigSource` in `/platforms/web/ini/.webapp.dev.ini` to point to a valid app config from your JWP account.

> **NOTE:** Only use the development server for development purposes. The development server is not optimized for production usage.

5. Build a deployable version of the JW OTT Webapp source code.<br /><br />This command creates a new folder in the projects root folder named **build**.
   The `public` folder from the build directory can be uploaded to any static hosting provider to run the web app from that host.

```shell
$ cd platforms/web
$ yarn build
```

If you have not made any changes to the JW OTT Webapp configuration or source code, changes can now be made. Be sure to run the `yarn build` command after making any changes.

If you encounter any errors, first check to make sure you've properly updated `/platforms/web/ini/.webapp.prod.ini` to point `defaultConfigSource` to your production app config from your JWP account.

## Modes

We make use of [Vite's 'mode' concept](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes) to cleanly separate different deployments.
For most cases, you will want to use `dev`, `test`, or `prod` modes. The supported modes are described below.

Please keep in mind that there is a nuanced difference between vite `mode` and whether you are running a development or production build as determined by [`NODE_ENV`](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/nodejs-the-difference-between-development-and-production/).
Mode can be whatever different deployment environments that our application can be run in, while the build type will always be either `development` or `production`.
Typically, when you run the development server using `yarn start`, it will be a `development` build, and you build the code with `yarn build` and then host it from static hosting, you will be running a production build.

Production builds optimize code and minimize debug information, while development builds are made for developers to dig into.

- **dev** - used for developers to locally develop, test, and debug code. Has the most debug information, including a config selector to help developers quickly switch between app configs. Will allow any app config to be loaded.
- **test** - used when running unit and e2e tests. Should typically be run as a production build. Will only load a select list of test app configs.
- **prod** - default used when running `yarn build` to create compiled code for production hosting. You should make sure to update the prod .ini file to only allow app configs from your account.
- **demo** - used for the [JWP preview site](https://app-preview.jwplayer.com/) and includes a dialog to switch between app configs. Will allow any app-config to be loaded and does not have a default config.
- **preview** - used for GitHub PR previews. Behaves like a hybrid between dev and demo.
- **jwdev** - this mode is for running code on JW's internal dev environment. It will only work for JW employees on the internal network.

## Env Variables

To allow for adjustments to be made at compile time, there are several env variables that get replaced during [vite compile](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables).
These values are then defacto constants, which means code optimizations can remove unused code such as if/else checks using them.

For non-sensitive values, you can add them directly to the appropriate .env file for each mode.

For sensitive values, if building with GitHub actions, we recommend using [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) and setting them in the [build action environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables).
You can see an example of how these are used in our [Firebase Live / Preview actions.](https://github.com/jwplayer/ott-web-app/blob/develop/.github/workflows/firebase-live.yml#L14)

If building manually, you can create an .env.[mode].local file and add the values there. These files are git ignored which will prevent leaking your secrets to version control.

> Note: env variables must begin with the 'APP\_' prefix or they are ignored by our vite configuration.

### APP_DEFAULT_CONFIG_SOURCE

The 8 character ID (or the url path) of the app config from your JWP account that the web app will use to load its content. Be careful to ensure that this config is always available or your app will fail to load.

If you are using pre-compiled builds instead of building the code yourself, you can also set this value with the [defaultConfigSource ini setting](initialization-file.md#defaultconfigsource).
Keep in mind, if the [defaultConfigSource ini setting](initialization-file.md#defaultconfigsource) is provided, it will be used even if the `APP_DEFAULT_CONFIG_SOURCE` environment variable is set.

### APP_PLAYER_ID

This value determines which player the OTT Web App loads from the JW Platform.
By default, the OTT Web App uses a global JWP OTT player that has its setting optimized to work properly with the app, but you can change it if you want to use a player directly from your own account.

If you are using pre-compiled builds instead of building the code yourself, you can also set this value with the [playerId ini setting](initialization-file.md#playerid).
Keep in mind, if the [playerId ini setting](initialization-file.md#playerid) is provided, it will be used even if the `APP_PLAYER_ID` environment variable is set.

> Note: Be careful if using your own player, since some settings in the player can conflict with the way the player is used in the OTT Web App, causing unexpected behavior or UX experiences.

> Note: If you opt to use the default global player, remember to provide your player key via the [APP_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY](#APP_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY) env variable or the [playerLicenseKey setting](initialization-file.md#playerLicenseKey) in the ini file.

### APP_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY

This value is used to set the player key when using the global player from the JW Platform.
The player relies on this key for certain features, such as analytics to work properly.

The value to use can be found labeled 'License Key' in the 'Self-Hosted Web Player' section in the ['Players' page on the JWP dashboard](https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/p/players).

If you link directly to your JWP cloud player using the [APP_PLAYER_ID](#app_player_id) environment variable or the [playerId ini setting](initialization-file.md#playerid), you do not need to provide a value for `APP_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY`.

It is recommended that this value be provided via a .env.local file or a GitHub secret to avoid saving it in version control.

If you are using pre-compiled builds instead of building the code yourself, you can also set this value with the [playerLicenseKey ini setting](initialization-file.md#playerLicenseKey).
Keep in mind, if the [playerLicenseKey ini setting](initialization-file.md#playerLicenseKey) is provided, it will be used even if the `APP_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable is set.
